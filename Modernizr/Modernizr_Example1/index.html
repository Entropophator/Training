<title>Modernizr Ultra Basic Script Load Example</title>
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/JavaScript" src="lib/script/modernizr.custom.15801.js"></script>

If you check the source of this page, you will see that "beer.js" is not loaded with the other scripts in the page head. <br>
The javascript alert comes from the "beer.js" file, which represents a capability not supported by the browser as detected by Modernizr.<br><br>

"loadchecks.js" calls Modernizr to check if "beer" is supported by the browser, as far as I am aware, no current browser supports any "beer" method, but they should.<br><br>

If you check the debugger, in the html class tag of index.html, you will see a series of class="js no-....", this is Modernizr posting what methods <br>
the browser page does NOT support, but should if it were HTML5 compliant. In loadchecks.js, I ask Modernizr if "beer" is supported, it is not, <br> 
so in loadchecks.js I tell Modernizr to load the "shim" file beer.js.
